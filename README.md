# 🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Prediction

## 📘 Project Overview
This project uses image processing and machine learning techniques to predict plant diseases based on leaf images. It is designed to assist farmers or agricultural researchers by detecting diseases early and improving crop health management.

## 📦 Contents of ZIP
The ZIP file `Plant-Leaf-Disease-Prediction-svohzq.zip` likely contains:
- Python code for training/testing the model
- Image datasets (or links to datasets)
- Model weights (if pretrained)
- Utility scripts for preprocessing, augmentation, etc.
- Possibly a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or `.py` files for inference or training

> 💡 Note: Unzip the file to explore and work with the contents. If you provide the exact structure, I can refine this section.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Common libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras opencv-python
#How to Run
